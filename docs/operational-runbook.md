## Cost Optimization System Procedures

### Crisis Response Procedures

#### Budget Alert: 80% Threshold Reached

**Immediate Diagnosis**
1. Access cost monitoring dashboard: `/admin/cost-monitoring`
2. Identify highest cost contexts:
```bash
# Firestore query
db.collection('ai_budget')
  .doc(currentMonth)
  .get()
  .then(doc => console.log(doc.data().byContext))
```

**Corrective Actions (Priority Order)**

**Level 1: Non-Disruptive Adjustments (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Increase cache TTL for high-cost contexts
- [ ] Expand fallback library for affected contexts
- [ ] Verify rate limits are active and properly configured
- [ ] Review and optimize recent AI usage patterns

**Level 2: Temporary Reduction (30 minutes)**
- [ ] Reduce rate limits by 25%:
```typescript
// rate-limiter.service.ts
customer: { chatbot: 5 â†’ 4, search: 10 â†’ 8 }
```
- [ ] Enable "cost-saving mode" for non-critical features
- [ ] Notify administrators of budget status
- [ ] Schedule review meeting for budget optimization

**Level 3: Emergency Measures (Immediate)**
- [ ] Activate budget circuit breaker
- [ ] Temporarily disable AI features for new users
- [ ] Force 50% fallback responses
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of budget threshold breach

#### Budget Alert: 100% Threshold Reached (Budget Exhausted)

**Immediate Diagnosis**
1. Confirm budget exhaustion via dashboard
2. Identify final usage spike cause
3. Check for any budget extension options

**Emergency Response (Immediate Action Required)**
- [ ] Activate full emergency mode
- [ ] Disable all AI services except critical operations
- [ ] Switch to 100% fallback responses
- [ ] Notify all users of service degradation
- [ ] Contact budget administrators for emergency funding
- [ ] Implement manual approval process for any AI usage

#### Rate Limiting Incident Response

**Symptom: Rate Limit Exceeded Alerts**

**Diagnosis**
1. Check rate limiting dashboard for violations
2. Identify affected user/service patterns:
```typescript
// Check rate limit violations
db.collection('rate_limit_violations')
  .where('timestamp', '>', lastHour)
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .limit(50)
```

**Response Procedures**

**Immediate Actions (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Temporarily increase rate limits for affected services
- [ ] Enable progressive backoff for violating clients
- [ ] Notify affected users of temporary restrictions

**Investigation (15 minutes)**
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns causing violations
- [ ] Check for potential abuse or system issues
- [ ] Review rate limit configurations

**Resolution Steps**
- [ ] Implement adaptive rate limiting if needed
- [ ] Update rate limit policies based on findings
- [ ] Document incident and preventive measures

## Cache Hit Rate Monitoring and Optimization

#### Symptom: Cache Hit Rate <50%

**Diagnosis**
1. Review logs of most frequent queries:
```typescript
db.collection('ai_usage_logs')
  .where('timestamp', '>', last24h)
  .orderBy('prompt')
  .limit(100)
```

2. Identify non-cacheable queries:
   - Highly varied prompts (solution: normalization)
   - Very short TTLs (solution: extend)
   - Excessive cache invalidation (solution: review triggers)

**Corrective Actions**
- [ ] Improve semantic key generation
- [ ] Add fallbacks for frequently uncached queries
- [ ] Review cache expiration logic
- [ ] Implement cache warming for common queries
- [ ] Monitor cache performance metrics

### System Health Monitoring Procedures

**Daily Health Checks**
- [ ] Verify all services are responding (API endpoints)
- [ ] Check database connectivity and performance
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates and memory usage
- [ ] Review error logs for patterns
- [ ] Validate backup completion status

**Automated Monitoring Alerts**
- [ ] Response time > 2 seconds
- [ ] Error rate > 5%
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Cache miss rate > 70%
- [ ] Memory usage > 85%

**Incident Response for System Degradation**
1. **High Response Times**
   - Scale up server instances
   - Check database query performance
   - Clear application caches if needed
   - Enable query optimization

2. **High Error Rates**
   - Review recent deployments
   - Check external service dependencies
   - Roll back to previous version if necessary
   - Enable circuit breakers

3. **Database Issues**
   - Check connection pool status
   - Verify database server health
   - Implement read replicas if available
   - Contact database administrators

### Emergency Mode Procedures

#### Activation Criteria
- Budget exceeded 100%
- Critical system failure
- Security breach detected
- External service outage affecting core functionality

#### Emergency Mode Activation
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Enable emergency mode flag in configuration
   - [ ] Switch all AI services to fallback mode
   - [ ] Disable non-essential features
   - [ ] Notify all active users of emergency status

2. **Service Degradation Steps**
   - [ ] Reduce API rate limits to minimum
   - [ ] Enable read-only mode for data operations
   - [ ] Activate backup systems if available
   - [ ] Implement manual approval for critical operations

#### Emergency Mode Deactivation
1. **Recovery Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm root cause resolution
   - [ ] Test system functionality with sample requests
   - [ ] Verify budget status and external services
   - [ ] Perform gradual load testing

2. **Gradual Restoration**
   - [ ] Slowly increase rate limits
   - [ ] Re-enable AI services incrementally
   - [ ] Monitor system performance during restoration
   - [ ] Notify users of service restoration
